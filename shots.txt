0. Best of SemanticKernel and AutoGen. Abstraction for Agents that are created anywhere, CoPilot Studio, AI Foundry, MCP, A2A, Custom.

1. ChatClient Providers all conform to IChatClient making it easy to swap out Providers

Sample with OpenAI and Ollama ChatClients where they each are created as IChatClient and then passed to a function to CreateAIAgent and invoke it

2. Multi-turn with AgentThread. InMemory, persistent, long running

Sample with follow-up questions

3. AIAgent base makes custom agent creation super simple. No LLM required.

Example for ISD SHOTS using InMemory ThreadProvider
Run and RunStreaming both take messages and return messages



Note: Think about Agents, Tools, Workflows as input and output. Everything has been abstracted to this simple construct.

4. Agent as Tool. Chat Agent uses ISD SHOTS Agent

Example uses ISD SHOTS agent 

5. Agent as MCP Server
